Private network chatbox

The chatbox is designed to work on private local networks as long as you have all the required access.
The application is developed with very basic understanding of Socket Programming.
I have used Socket module for Socket Programming and Tkinter for GUI.

The application is defined in to parts 
  1.Server Part
  2.Client part
  
 Note: I have given the IP cofigurations to run the program on the same PC. To run the program on 2 different machines on the same private
       network , please update the IP Config in Client program
       And the Server side program needs to be executed first (Working towards removing this limitation).

The Project is still under development.....
